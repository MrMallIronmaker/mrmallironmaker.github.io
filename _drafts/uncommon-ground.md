title: Uncommon Ground
---
Augmented reality breaks a key assumption we make every day: we presume we s    ee what the other sees.
We are only beginning our understanding of its effects on communication.
I have the opportunity to run research studies as a volunteer at the San Jose Tech Museum.
It is good to do for many reasons - a more diverse participant pool, informa    l science education in the community - but today, I highlight the ability to     watch first-time, natural encounters with new technology. 
The museum was slow, so I brough the HoloLens headset we work with to my co-worker in the booth next to mine.
i had recently started working there at that location booth so tshe was curious as to what was happening .
I placgave her the direciton o but on the headset, and then sadi... what now?
I didn't really know what ot do, ... Normally I can step people through a technical problem beaucase i can see there screen - sometimes I can't but that makes solivng the problem much harder.
i couldn't see what he was seeing, because naturally it's on the headset. So i had to stumble through verball y explaing the menus and actions. This is was vafar less smooth becaus eit was not something i could see - i didn't have that common ground, so we had to aestablish it verball y rather than visually.

second, the sub acme *next shift person came by, who got the hololens headset netctx.t. Though I had more experience examplinging it [as it was in my head] both of us slaughed ** the other cowoerk laughed at the new person pointing and tapping in air, szoned in on vosomething that was invisible. 

These two cahappenings cfundamentally changed the natural of the interaction. * changed it in way different from other popular media - mostly it's about presence, about technology making possible something in face to face... --- nix that.

these two happenings fundamentally changed the innature of the interaction. The principle broken here i called 'common ground ' It's a theory by Herb Clark on communication... communication relies upon what I know that you know, and that you know I know. I can't begin to talk about this theory until I explain it , untiless ....

[ add more points ]

In this light, augmented reality as it is instantiated today in a fundamentally individual experience. for those outside of the world. But is it likely to stay this way? For example, ARCore and ArKit alow could anotchors to give the same virtual space as we ll as the same phiscal space. That may work us** what that may extend to all devices - its merely a matter of building the tright texchnology and user interafaces for sahring. Howevr, there will still be unobservable content - I wdon't think we will share our virtual content with everyone around aus all the time. , unless we have a radical shift n our views of information and privacy. [cut that past lart] And to the second point, will we grow used to gesturs in thein air and starting off into space, and adapt our social exptectioant and habits of interpretation in orderto compensate? We may adapt them intelectually, as we do with bluetooht heaadsets . I still notice when someone around me is talking on the headset, as I am cnfused for who they are talking to. There is no usualy visual cue - a hand up, a person nearby, a hand holding a phone - for thowho they are talking to. And while I may quickly go back to work, I would aregue [tonly evidenced by self-reflection] ther eis still some residual, low-level effect. [my intiotion..]

Ishould add the caveat that I dn't beleive this is a n apocalyptic scenario. But the key part is that we' don't know the effect... but it's something we run into within ive seconds of trying it on. There have been many things I've notived about social cues that rely on this common ground picnipel. and seeI seem to notice them weekly.
