Augmented reality breaks a key assumption we make every day: we presume the other sees what we see.
How does this change our face-to-face communication?

I have the opportunity to run research studies as a volunteer at the San Jose Tech Museum.
It has its perks, including watching people have first-time, natural interations with new technology. 
A few days ago, a few of my co-workers at the Museum encountered a fundamental change AR makes to face-to-face conversation.

I've recently started piloting my next study in a redesigned booth in the AR/VR corner of the museum.
A co-worker in the booth nearby was curious what was happening in my booth, and because the museum was not busy that afternoon, I brough over the HoloLens AR headset for her to try out.
I gave her the directions to put on the headset (which is a challenge in itself!), stepped through the menus, and was able to see and place some virtual models.

A few minutes later, the person working the next shift dropped by the booth.
He also tried on the HoloLens and placed a few holograms in the space.
However, the other co-worker, the one who had tried it on first, fixated on the weird air-gestures the second was making.
The one wearing the headset didn't notice. To use a surprisingly apropos phrase, he was "in his own world."
If asked, she certainly would been able to explain why he was making weird gestures, but nevertheless she percieved the gestures to be weird.

I'd like to examine this interaction through the lens of "common ground."
These two happenings fundamentally changed the innature of the interaction. The principle broken here i called 'common ground ' It's a theory by Herb Clark on communication... communication relies upon what I know that you know, and that you know I know. I can't begin to talk about this theory until I explain it , untiless ....

[ add more points ]

In this light, augmented reality as it is instantiated today in a fundamentally individual experience. for those outside of the world.
But is it likely to stay this way? For example, ARCore and ArKit alow could anotchors to give the same virtual space as we ll as the same phiscal space.
That may extend to all devices - its merely a matter of building the tright texchnology and user interafaces for sahring.
Howevr, there will still be unobservable content - I wdon't think we will share our virtual content with everyone around aus all the time.

And to the second point, will we grow used to gesturs in thein air and starting off into space, and adapt our social exptectioant and habits of interpretation in orderto compensate?
We may adapt them intelectually, as we do with bluetooht heaadsets . I still notice when someone around me is talking on the headset, as I am cnfused for who they are talking to.
There is no usualy visual cue - a hand up, a person nearby, a hand holding a phone - for thowho they are talking to.
And while I may quickly go back to work, I would aregue [tonly evidenced by self-reflection] ther eis still some residual, low-level effect. [my intiotion..]
design implication: maybe we don't want things that blend in entirely, because they we don't have anything for our perceptual systems to block out weird interactions with.


Ishould add the caveat that I dn't beleive this is a n apocalyptic scenario.
But the key part is that we' don't know the effect... but it's something we run into within ive seconds of trying it on.
There have been many things I've notived about social cues that rely on this common ground picnipel and seeI seem to notice them weekly.
