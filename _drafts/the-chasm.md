title: AR's Chasm: Real v. Virtual
---
One unique feature of augmented reality is its blend of the real and the virtual.
Does the juxtaposition between real and virtual mean we perceive AR differently from VR?

- behavioral realism is important
- AR does crossover specifically
- is crossover better? it might be...
- when do we want realism?

- be consistent between visual v behavioral realism.

- AR's juxtaposition poses a behavioral realism challenge!
- and if you add behavioral realism, you get results
- but it doesn't really answer the question of how much that juxtaposition matters, and so doesn't show AR v VR differences.

Virtual reality is AR's "big brother" - it is a larger and more mature field, and oftentimes its questions and measures are hand-me-downs from VR.
While this has many benefits, we must be cautious not to overextend the similarities between the two.
Detailing situations that are particular to AR allow some separation between the two.
To continue the familial metaphor, AR begins to come of age, developing its own identity separate from VR.

The most prominent distinction between the two is that AR integrates into the real world.
I do feel the superlative is justified, certainly in our current understanding of AR and VR.
That distinction is my short answer when people ask me "What's different between AR and VR?"
How does this integration [or juxtaposition] of real and virtual affect our feelings of realism and our behaviors?

If one is familiar with human behavior in virtual reality, one might claim we don't perceive virtual objects all that differently from real ones, and so there is no problem.
Though it often surprises those learning about VR, it is quite easy for us to treat virtual objects as real, even with very low visual fidelity.
People will easily and naturally dodge virtual projectiles, avoid virtual pits, and give virtual humans a normal amount of personal space.

I argue this should be more intuitive if thought about further.
When I walk around my apartment at night without glasses or contacts, the visual fidelity of my apartment is horrible.
Yet I don't bump into walls or run into my flatmate - I can still perceive the scene fairly well.
I speculate the human perceptual system is prepared for cases in which the entire environment becomes in some way 'strange' [e.g, bright, dark, fuzzy, blocky] because there is a likely cause - some problem in the optical part of the visual system.
In contrast, times when two groups of objects are in contrast are much less common, and so I would speculate it is somewhat more difficult for the brain to reconcile the two parts of the scene.

Not sure where this is leading now:
The ideal study would contrast the same behavioral realism, but connected to different objects - a virtual and a real one.

Yet following the rule that behavioral realism, i.e, how a thing acts, tends to outweight visual realism, i.e, how a thing looks, one may suggest the idea that interactions between the real and virtual world will overcome the  


One can make a 
but something that is AR particular is the line between the real nad virtua
- it is plasuible for one to believe that when everything looks virtual, one becomes accustomed to it
but when different media are compbined [think Who Framed Roger Rabbit or Space Jam] does wouldn't the distinction seem more persistent?

Taking the lead from these movies, we have theree studies that explore the idea that realizim can be increased by interactions between the real and first ual workd.

The first is a pper from 2016 working with a wobbly tamble.
The participants sit down at tone end of a table.
Ath the other end, there is a screen on whcih the other halg of the table ins projected.

There is a virtual huamman and a virtula table.
The virtual human goes through a game of 20 questions twith the participant, occasionally lifting hands frup from the table, cauor placing them down, causing them the table to wobble - the virtual ahhalf and physical half o the tables are syncrhonized effectively.
in this way, the table can be incfluence both the physical world [ the partiiciapnt leaning on it] and in the virtual world [the vh leaning on it].
participants in the wobbly condition found a fairly strong (d=1.0) sense of presence with the wobbly effects.

But how do these effects break down? IS one effect strong ther than the other - should the physical world become actuated by the real**vrtual world, but or should the virtual world become mroe awayre of the physical world? of course, the science is far from finished, but her *we have evidence that both directions play a role.

In the first, Kim et al look at the effect of behavioral plausibility on the perception of a virtual human.
In once case, the VH phases through a chair, is not occuluded by the table, and aphases through a door.
In th other case, the VH asked to open the door , chair, and is occluded by the table.
Nautrally, the VH is reacted bwith more presence, intelligence, and smething ese when its behavior is more plasuible.

In the seonc, kim at etal look at changes in the virtual world baed upon physical occurenes - in the room where they are tsting, they run a tfan.
and have a wind sensor
The virutla huobjects either do not change, or the paper and curtains flutter and the pvirtua lperson tries to shifts her hands on the paper in order ot prevent it from fluttering omore
The virtual human who reacts is more present and is etc etc effects.

These three studies, taken together, lend weight to the idea that this real / virtual divide is at least one of the differences particular to AR. 

What exactly matters? There are a lot of measurs being thrown around

[ add in steptoe et al] 
Steptoe showed AR scenes in a see-through AR display
when disteail was lost by stylinging or virtualizing it, people had a harder time discerning itwhat was virtual and what was real, and  [anah this is veryyy different.

Twaht exactly matters? there are a lot of measres being thrown around and there is anot much theory tyet to predict why these things matter [as it should be, this is new world]
. When might we want full presence of virtual objects? When might we want ? Will that *** when might we want some differenece/ Will that be a choice made tby content developers or users? right now I hve the opton of turning down the HoloLens brightness in order to let the background shine through or no.t.
