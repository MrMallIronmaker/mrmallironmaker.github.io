title: Begin with the End in Mind: Why Write?
---
Academic communication is a difficult yet integral part of any researcher's work.
I have begun this blog to write regularly, helping me become a better communicator, and to spark discussion within the augmented reality research community - first, at Stanford, and then at large.

It is entirely natural that writing - research communication - is so important.
The premise of research, especially publicly funded research, is an investment of some time and money and brainpower in order to discover truths that in some way serve the wider world.
If these truths are not communicated well, the research doesn't bear the fruit it could have.
The best way to become better is to practice, so the best way to become a better writer is to practice writing. 

The second reason I start this blog is to share the moments of research inspiration and insight with both those I know and those I have not met yet.
I am working on my first paper in which I am responsible for most of the writing.
As the authors and I have worked over the introduction multiple times, I keep finding questions, descriptions, and insights that are not paper material, but I feel they are worth discussing.
Naturally, I want to share these insights, or at least have them for reference and revision in the future.

Augmented reality is a field with very much excitement - some justified, some not - and these insights will be useful to those looking to understand the technology and its applications.
Each year, throughout the year, I meet new students here at Stanford excited about augmented reality and its applications.
I want to collect and organize our insights so we can learn from each other and be trailblazers in this new medium.

Ultimately, writing is the best way to share ideas and spark new ones. It's time to join the conversation.
