Hi there!

I'm a third-year Ph.D. student with the Department of Computer Science at Stanford University and a member of the [Virtual Human Interaction Lab](https://vhil.stanford.edu). 
My current research interests include social interaction and interpersonal communication in augmented and virtual reality, with a side of computer science education.
I graduated from Computer Science program of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

If you'd like to discuss my work or augmented reality in general, drop me a line at `mrmillr at stanford dot edu`.
